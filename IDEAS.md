# Ideas

Thoughts that went into planning and implementing this project.

**v0.0.4**
Put data into jason files. Get gulp compiling handlebars. Get gulp data feeding gulp handlebars. Projects as partials.

**v0.0.3**
Better description. New name. All basic pages added.

Should we concat json files?

**v0.0.2**
Gulp tasks running. Other basic pages constructed. Add fonts.

**v0.0.1**
Most files in place. Structure decisions made. Basic html layout in place.
